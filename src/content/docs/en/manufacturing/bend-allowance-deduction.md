Accurate calculation of the **developed length** in bent sheet metal parts depends on two complementary concepts: the **bend allowance** (BA) and the **bend deduction** (BD). BA represents the arc length of the neutral fiber along the bend radius, while BD is the amount that must be subtracted from the sum of the external flange dimensions to obtain the total flat blank length. Both values depend on material thickness, inside radius, bend angle, and the **K** factor, which defines the position of the neutral fiber. Using the correct formulas avoids dimensional errors and ensures that the final part meets specifications.

## Calculation formulas
For a bend with inside radius **R**, thickness **T**, bend angle **A** (in degrees), and K factor **k** (dimensionless), the following expressions apply:

- **Bend Allowance (BA)** = (π / 180) × A × (R + k × T)
- **Outside setback (OSSB)** = tan(A / 2) × (R + T)
- **Bend Deduction (BD)** = 2 × OSSB − BA
- **Developed length (L)** = Σ flat lengths of flanges + Σ BA  (bend allowance method)
- Alternatively: **L** = Σ (outside dimensions of flanges) − Σ BD  (deduction method)

Conversion between BA and BD is immediate from the formulas above. The most common method in sheet metal design is the bend deduction method, because it works directly with the outside dimensions measured on the drawing.

## Key parameters and factors

| Parameter | Typical value / Range | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **K factor (mild steel)** | 0.33 – 0.40 | — |
| **K factor (stainless steel 304)** | 0.40 – 0.45 | — |
| **K factor (aluminum 5052-O)** | 0.40 – 0.45 | — |
| **K factor (ductile copper)** | 0.35 – 0.42 | — |
| **Recommended minimum inside radius** | ≥ 1 × T | mm / in |
| **Minimum flange width** | ≥ 4T + R | mm / in |
| **Minimum distance of holes to bend edge** | ≥ 3T + R | mm / in |
| **Angular precision in air bending** | ±0.5° | degrees |

The K factor expresses the position of the neutral fiber as a fraction of the thickness, measured from the inside face of the bend. In air bending, the inside radius is approximately determined by the V-die opening; a common rule of thumb is that the natural inside radius equals 16% of the V opening.

## Applicable materials and selection guide
The following table lists the recommended design parameters for the most common materials in sheet metal bending. Bend allowances depend on the supply condition and thickness.

| Material | Typical thickness (mm / in) | Recommended minimum inside radius (mm / in) | Recommended K factor | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cold rolled steel DC01 | 1.0 / 0.039 | 1.0 / 0.039 | 0.37 | Bend perpendicular to rolling direction |
| Stainless steel AISI 304 | 1.5 / 0.059 | 1.5 / 0.059 | 0.42 | Allows parallel bending if Rb < 85 |
| Aluminum 5052-O | 2.0 / 0.079 | 2.0 / 0.079 | 0.43 | Excellent cold formability |
| Annealed copper | 0.8 / 0.031 | 0.8 / 0.031 | 0.38 | Avoid excessively sharp radii |
| Brass 70/30 half-hard | 1.2 / 0.047 | 1.5 / 0.059 | 0.40 | May require radius > 1.5T |

For materials with Rockwell B hardness greater than 70, bending parallel to the rolling direction is not recommended; perpendicular bending should be used and the inside radius increased up to 2T when necessary.

## Bending tolerances
Angular tolerance in air bending is approximately ±0.5°, provided that the punch stroke is kept constant and springback is compensated. In bottoming processes, angular precisions of ±0.25° can be achieved. Material thickness variation and tool wear directly affect the bend deduction; therefore, it is recommended to verify parameters with test pieces before serial production. For carbon steels, a typical tolerance on developed length is ±0.2 mm (±0.008 in) for thicknesses less than 3 mm (0.118 in).

## Advantages and limitations
The use of *Bend Allowance* and *Bend Deduction* formulas allows obtaining the exact flat pattern length, optimizing material consumption, and reducing workshop adjustments. It is a standardized procedure compatible with CAD/CAM software and with the parameter tables of press brakes. The main limitations are associated with the variability of the actual K factor in production, the influence of the die condition, and the nonlinearity of *springback* in high-strength materials. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a preliminary test for each material batch when tight tolerances are required.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **What angular precision can be expected in air bending of sheet metal?** Typical precision is ±0.5° under controlled conditions.

2. **What is the minimum inside radius for stainless steel AISI 304 in bending?** The minimum radius must be at least 1 times the material thickness; for example, for a sheet of 1.5 mm / 0.059 in, the minimum radius is 1.5 mm / 0.059 in.

3. **How much does a 2 mm / 0.079 in steel sheet lengthen when bent to 90° with a radius equal to the thickness?** The elongation measured as Bend Allowance is 4.40 mm / 0.173 in.

4. **What bend deduction should be applied for an aluminum sheet of 1.5 mm / 0.059 in with inside radius 1 mm / 0.039 in and 90° angle?** The bend deduction is 2.37 mm / 0.093 in, considering a K factor of 0.45.

5. **What is the minimum flange width for a press brake bend according to design standards?** The minimum width must be at least 4 times the thickness plus the inside radius; for a sheet of 2 mm / 0.079 in with a radius of 2 mm / 0.079 in, the minimum width is 10 mm / 0.39 in.

6. **How does the rolling direction affect the minimum bend radius in cold rolled steel?** For steel with Rockwell B hardness greater than 70, bending must be done perpendicular to the rolling direction to avoid fractures; the minimum radius remains at 1T under that orientation and may require up to 2T if bent parallel.
