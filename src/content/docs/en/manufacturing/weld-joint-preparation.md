Weld joint preparation defines the geometry of the edges to be joined before executing the weld bead and determines the accessibility, penetration, and strength of the final assembly. Proper selection of the preparation allows achieving the required complete penetration with minimum filler metal volume, reducing residual stresses and minimizing defects such as lack of fusion or slag inclusions. The process includes machining or grinding of edges according to standardized configurations — straight, V, bevel, J, or U — as well as the definition of root opening, bevel angle, and root face or land.

## Verified operating parameters
The geometric parameters of the preparation are selected based on the joint type, plate thickness, and welding process. The following table summarizes the most common reference values for butt joints in carbon steel welded by gas metal arc welding (GMAW/MAG) or shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), according to edge configuration.

### Parameter table by material
| Joint type | Material thickness | Included bevel angle | Root opening | Root face (land) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Butt – square edge | Up to 6.35 mm / 0.25 in | 0° | 0–1.5 mm / 0–0.06 in | N/A |
| Butt – single bevel (half V) | 3.0–12.0 mm / 0.12–0.47 in | 40°–60° | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in | 0.8–2.0 mm / 0.03–0.08 in |
| Butt – single V | 6.0–20.0 mm / 0.24–0.79 in | 50°–70° | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in | 1.0–2.5 mm / 0.04–0.10 in |
| Butt – double V | 12.0–40.0 mm / 0.47–1.57 in | 50°–70° (each side) | 0–2.0 mm / 0–0.08 in | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in |
| Butt – single J | 6.0–20.0 mm / 0.24–0.79 in | 15°–25° (radial bevel) | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in | 1.0–2.0 mm / 0.04–0.08 in |
| Butt – single U | 20.0–50.0 mm / 0.79–1.97 in | 20°–30° (radial bevel) | 0–2.5 mm / 0–0.10 in | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in |
| Butt – double U | 50.0–80.0 mm / 1.97–3.15 in | 20°–30° (each side) | 0–2.5 mm / 0–0.10 in | 1.5–3.0 mm / 0.06–0.12 in |

*Note*: The bevel angle and root opening values should be adjusted according to the welding process (e.g., in TIG, smaller openings are preferred) and the working position. For austenitic stainless steels, it is recommended to reduce the root opening by 10% to 20% relative to the tabulated values, due to the higher fluidity of the weld pool.

## Typical tolerances
The allowable tolerances in joint preparation for welding of pipes and fittings according to ASME/ANSI B16.9 and B16.25 standards are as follows:

| Parameter | Typical tolerance |
|---|---|
| Bevel angle | ±2° |
| Root opening | ±0.8 mm / ±0.03 in |
| Root face | ±0.5 mm / ±0.02 in |
| Edge misalignment (offset) | 1.5 mm / 0.06 in maximum, or 10% of nominal wall thickness |
| Ovality at prepared pipe ends | 1% of outside diameter, maximum 6 mm / 0.24 in |
| Surface roughness of prepared edge | Ra ≤ 12.5 µm / 500 µin (machined); Ra ≤ 25 µm / 1000 µin (ground oxyfuel-cut) |

These tolerances apply to butt joints in carbon steel, stainless steel, and nickel alloy pipes and ducts. For thin sheet elements (thickness ≤ 3 mm / 0.12 in) misalignment must not exceed 0.3 mm / 0.012 in.

## Applicable materials
Joint preparation applies to all weldable structural materials, although the selection of geometry and machining parameters depends on the properties of the base material:

- **Carbon steel (thickness 0.5–80 mm / 0.02–3.15 in)**: Supports all edge configurations. Mechanized oxyfuel cutting is used up to thicknesses of 150 mm / 5.9 in, followed by grinding to remove the heat-affected zone and achieve the specified roughness.
- **Austenitic stainless steel (300 series)**: Preferably prepared by CNC machining or high-definition plasma. Double V or U preparation reduces distortion due to stress balancing. Avoid contamination with free iron during machining to prevent localized corrosion.
- **Martensitic stainless steel**: Limited weldability; preheating and cooling control are required. Preparation is usually single V with reduced angle (40°–50°) and larger root face (2–3 mm / 0.08–0.12 in) to avoid cold cracking.
- **Aluminum and alloys**: The oxide layer must be removed immediately before welding (maximum 4 hours of ambient exposure). Preparations with larger bevel angle (70°–90°) and wide root opening (up to 4.0 mm / 0.16 in) compensate for high thermal conductivity and ensure complete fusion. Water jet cutting or dry cutting disc avoids contamination.
- **Nickel alloys**: Behavior similar to austenitic stainless steel, but with higher weld pool viscosity. Single bevel or double V with bevel angle of 30°–37.5° and root face of 1.5–2.5 mm / 0.06–0.10 in are used.

Preparation is not recommended for dissimilar joints with a large difference in melting point (e.g., steel–aluminum) due to lack of compatibility in the weld pool.

## Advantages and limitations

### Advantages
- Bevel preparation allows full root access and guaranteed penetration in thicknesses greater than 6.35 mm / 0.25 in.
- Double groove configurations (double V, double U) reduce filler metal volume by up to 40% compared to the equivalent single groove, decreasing stresses and distortion.
- Machined preparation reproduces tight tolerances (±0.5 mm / ±0.02 in on root face) and repeatability in serial production.
- Facilitates non-destructive inspection (ultrasound, radiography) by eliminating irregularities at the root interface.

### Limitations
- The cost of preparation by machining or grinding can represent up to 25% of the total manufacturing time of a welded joint in thick sections.
- Material removal reduces the resistant cross-section at the bevel; errors in angle or root opening can cause burn-through, lack of fusion, or inclusions.
- J and U preparations require special cutting tools (radius cutters) and are economically justifiable only for thicknesses greater than 20 mm / 0.79 in.
- In field assemblies, edge misalignment greater than 1.5 mm / 0.06 in may impose corrective beveling that increases the effective root opening and filler metal consumption.

## Selection guide
The choice of joint preparation follows a decision sequence based on thickness, accessibility, and welding process:

1. **Thickness ≤ 6.35 mm / 0.25 in and access from one side only** → square edge, fusion welding with full penetration, possibly with removable backing.
2. **Thickness 4.5–12.0 mm / 0.18–0.47 in, access from both sides** → single bevel or single V with included angle of 60° and root opening of 2.0 mm / 0.08 in. Allows back gouging.
3. **Thickness 12.0–25.0 mm / 0.47–0.98 in, access from both sides** → double V to balance stresses and minimize distortion.
4. **Thickness 20.0–50.0 mm / 0.79–1.97 in, limited access to one side only** → single J or single U; the smaller bevel angle reduces filler volume and number of passes.
5. **Thickness > 40.0 mm / 1.57 in, access from both sides** → double U or double J. These geometries have the highest preparation cost but offer maximum strength and lowest filler material consumption in critical joints (pressure vessels, offshore structures).

For submerged arc welding (SAW) processes, the root opening can be increased by 1.0–2.0 mm / 0.04–0.08 in to improve root pass penetration, while in GTAW (TIG) a root opening of zero or 0.5 mm / 0.02 in maximum is recommended when welding autogenously or with fine filler rod.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Up to what plate thickness can a square edge butt joint be used without bevel?
The square edge butt joint without preparation is limited to thicknesses up to 6.35 mm / 0.25 in for welding from both sides, and up to 3.0 mm / 0.12 in if only accessible from one side.

### What is the recommended bevel angle for a single V joint in 12 mm thick carbon steel?
The recommended included angle is 60°, with a root opening of 2.5 mm / 0.10 in and a root face of 1.5 mm / 0.06 in, for SMAW or GMAW processes in flat position.

### How much filler metal is saved by using a double U preparation compared to a single V in 50 mm thickness?
Double U preparation can reduce filler metal volume by 35% to 45% compared to a single V of the same thickness, decreasing angular distortion and number of passes.

### What tolerance is allowed for root opening according to ASME B16.25 standards for 6-inch diameter pipes?
The typical tolerance for root opening is ±0.8 mm / ±0.03 in, provided the minimum wall thickness after beveling is maintained.

### When is it appropriate to use a J edge preparation instead of a single bevel?
J preparation is justified for thicknesses between 20 mm / 0.79 in and 50 mm / 1.97 in, especially when welding from one side is required; the radius reduces stress concentration at the root and requires up to 30% less filler metal than an equivalent single bevel.

### How many hours after machining the bevel must an aluminum joint be welded to avoid excessive oxidation?
Welding must be completed within 4 hours after edge preparation; if this time is exceeded, the surface must be cleaned again with a dedicated stainless steel brush or chemically pickled.
