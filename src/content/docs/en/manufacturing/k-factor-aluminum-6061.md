## Definition and use of K-factor in sheet metal bending

The K-factor represents the ratio between the distance from the neutral axis to the inner face of the bend and the material thickness, typically ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 for aluminum 6061. In sheet metal bending, this dimensionless coefficient allows precise calculation of the developed length and bend deduction by predicting the position of the fiber that experiences neither elongation nor compression. The 6061 alloy, with an elastic modulus of 68 GPa / 9 900 ksi and a wide elongation range (12–25% according to Wikipedia), requires careful adjustment of the K-factor depending on the temper and bend radius to achieve tolerances of ±0,1 mm / ±0,004 in in the development.

## K-factor values for aluminum 6061

The K-factor for aluminum 6061‑T6 under standard bending conditions (inner radius equal to thickness) is 0.33, while for 6061‑O it rises to 0.40. These values are derived from cold bending tests and reflect the greater ductility of the annealed material. The following table summarizes the most common K-factors as a function of the heat treatment state and the ratio between the inner radius (R) and thickness (T).

| Temper of aluminum 6061 | R/T ≤ 1 | R/T = 2 | R/T = 3 | R/T ≥ 5 |
|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| O (annealed)              | 0,40    | 0,42    | 0,44    | 0,45    |
| T4                        | 0,37    | 0,39    | 0,41    | 0,43    |
| T6 / T651                 | 0,33    | 0,35    | 0,37    | 0,40    |

## Factors affecting K-factor in aluminum 6061

The tensile strength, ranging from 124 MPa / 18 ksi (O) to 290 MPa / 42 ksi (T6), and ductility (elongation 12–25%) are the main determinants of the K-factor. The T6 temper, artificially aged, hardens the aluminum matrix and shifts the neutral axis toward the inside of the bend, reducing the K-factor to 0.33–0.37. In the annealed condition (O), the material flows more easily and the K-factor reaches 0.40–0.45. Other influencing parameters are the bend radius relative to thickness (R/T) and the strain rate; an increase in R/T raises the K-factor because the strain gradient is less severe.

## Calculation of developed length and bend deduction

The developed length (L) is calculated using the formula L = A + B + BA, where A and B are the straight flange lengths and BA is the bend allowance. For a bend angle θ, BA = (π/180) · θ · (R + K · T). The bend deduction (BD) is obtained as BD = 2 · (R + T) – BA. Example for 1.5 mm / 0.059 in aluminum 6061‑T6 sheet, inner radius 1.5 mm / 0.059 in, K = 0.33, θ = 90°: BA = 2.34 mm / 0.0921 in; BD = 4.5 mm / 0.1772 in – 2.34 mm / 0.0921 in = 2.16 mm / 0.0850 in.

## Typical bending tolerances

The variability of the K-factor in aluminum 6061, due to differences in temper and batch homogeneity, imposes a tolerance of ±0.02 on the nominal K-factor value. This translates into an uncertainty in the development of approximately ±0.08 mm / ±0.003 in for thicknesses of 1.5 mm / 0.059 in. The final dimensional tolerances of the bent flange are typically ±0.2 mm / ±0.008 in when using precision tooling, and are validated by batch calibration.

## Applicable materials and their comparison

Although the K-factor is intrinsic to each alloy, the knowledge base of aluminum 6061 serves as a reference for other 6xxx series alloys. Its mechanical properties — density 2.70 g/cm³ / 0.098 lb/in³ and thermal conductivity 151‑202 W/(m·K) — make it comparable to 5052‑H32 (K ≈ 0.40) and mild steel (K ≈ 0.45). However, the greater stiffness of 6061‑T6 (yield strength 240 MPa / 35 ksi) requires a lower K-factor than in soft alloys.

## Advantages of using K-factor in aluminum 6061

The application of the specific K-factor for 6061‑T6 allows a development accuracy of ±0.1 mm / ±0.004 in in series production, reducing material waste and setup time. The good weldability and wide availability of 6061 in T6 temper make this K-factor a de facto standard in aerospace and automotive applications. Furthermore, the linear expansion coefficient of 2.32×10⁻⁵ K⁻¹ (1.29×10⁻⁵ °F⁻¹) ensures predictable dimensional stability after bending over a wide temperature range.

## Limitations

The K-factor of 0.33 for 6061‑T6 is only valid when the inner radius is at least equal to the thickness; more aggressive radii (R/T < 0.5) cause cracking and nonlinear variation of the K-factor. The influence of the rolling direction, especially in thicknesses greater than 3 mm / 0.118 in, can produce K-factor differences of up to 0.05 between longitudinal and transverse bends. Lastly, uneven temper across a single part requires verification of the actual temper before adopting the tabulated value.

## K-factor selection guide

Select the K-factor according to the temper and the R/T ratio, using 0.33 as a starting point for 6061‑T6 with R/T = 1 and adjusting to 0.40 for 6061‑O. For designs with critical tolerances (< 0.15 mm / 0.006 in on the developed length), perform a test batch and calculate the empirical K-factor from the bent part, correcting the table with the measured value. In multi-bend parts, assign an independent K-factor to each radius to maintain overall accuracy.
