Casting is a manufacturing process in which molten metal is poured or injected into a mold that contains a cavity with the desired geometry, allowing the production of parts with complex shapes that would be difficult or uneconomical to manufacture by other methods. The proper selection of the process depends on production volume, required material, necessary dimensional accuracy, and expected mechanical properties. This guide presents the critical parameters to compare the main casting processes and facilitate technical decision-making.

## Materials

The selection of material is decisive for choosing the casting process, since each technique has specific metallurgical limitations. Melting temperature, fluidity, reactivity with the mold, and shrinkage tendency define the material-process compatibility.

| Process | Applicable metallic materials |
|---|---|
| Sand casting | Gray iron, ductile iron, carbon steels, stainless steels, aluminum alloys, bronze, brass, magnesium alloys |
| Investment casting (lost wax) | Stainless steels, carbon steels, nickel and cobalt base superalloys, titanium, aluminum alloys, bronze, brass |
| Permanent mold casting (gravity die casting) | Aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, copper alloys (bronze, brass), gray iron |
| Die casting (high pressure) | Aluminum alloys (AA 380, AA 384, AA 390), zinc alloys (Zamak), magnesium alloys, copper alloys |
| Centrifugal casting | Gray iron, ductile iron, steels, stainless steels, copper alloys, aluminum alloys |

Aluminum alloys dominate die casting and permanent mold casting due to their excellent fluidity when alloyed with silicon (8.5–17%), while zinc allows faster cycles due to its low melting temperature of approximately 425 °C / 800 °F. Ferrous alloys, with melting temperatures above 1450 °C / 2642 °F, require processes such as sand or investment casting that can withstand higher thermal demand.

## Tolerances and finishes

Dimensional accuracy and surface quality vary significantly between processes and determine the amount of subsequent machining required. Die casting achieves the most demanding standards in mass production, while sand casting requires larger machining allowances.

| Process | Typical dimensional tolerance | Surface roughness Ra |
|---|---|---|
| Sand casting (green) | ±1.5 mm / ±0.06 in (up to 150 mm / 6 in); ±0.5 mm / ±0.02 in for each additional 25 mm / 1 in | 5–25 µm / 200–1000 µin |
| Sand casting (chemical resin) | ±0.5 mm / ±0.02 in (up to 150 mm / 6 in); ±0.3 mm / ±0.012 in for each additional 25 mm / 1 in | 3.2–12.5 µm / 126–500 µin |
| Investment casting | ±0.1 mm / ±0.004 in (up to 25 mm / 1 in); ±0.075 mm / ±0.003 in for each additional 25 mm / 1 in | 1.6–3.2 µm / 63–126 µin |
| Permanent mold casting | ±0.4 mm / ±0.016 in (up to 25 mm / 1 in); ±0.25 mm / ±0.01 in for each additional 25 mm / 1 in | 2.5–6.3 µm / 100–250 µin |
| Die casting | ±0.1 mm / ±0.004 in (up to 25 mm / 1 in); ±0.05 mm / ±0.002 in for each additional 25 mm / 1 in; accuracy up to 0.2% of part dimension | 0.8–3.2 µm / 32–126 µin |

Die casting can achieve accuracies of up to 0.2% of the nominal dimension, in many cases allowing the complete elimination of subsequent machining. Tolerances depend directly on mold rigidity: metal molds (die casting, permanent mold) offer higher precision than bonded sand molds.

## Operating parameters by material

Each process imposes geometric and operational constraints that must be evaluated during the design stage. Parameters such as minimum wall thickness, draft angle, and maximum feasible mass define the technical feasibility of a geometry.

| Process | Minimum wall thickness | Minimum draft angle | Typical maximum part mass |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sand casting (green) | 3–5 mm / 0.12–0.20 in (ferrous); 2.5–4 mm / 0.10–0.16 in (non-ferrous) | 1–3° (external surfaces); 2–5° (internal) | No practical limit for green sand; 2300–2700 kg / 5100–6000 lb (dry sand) |
| Investment casting | 0.5–1 mm / 0.02–0.04 in | 0° (external surfaces with adequate design); 0.5–1° (internal) | 50 kg / 110 lb (typical); up to 250 kg / 550 lb (special) |
| Permanent mold casting | 3–4 mm / 0.12–0.16 in (aluminum); 4–5 mm / 0.16–0.20 in (iron) | 2–3° (external surfaces); 3–5° (internal) | 25 kg / 55 lb (aluminum); 50 kg / 110 lb (iron) |
| Die casting | 0.6 mm / 0.025 in (zinc); 0.9 mm / 0.035 in (aluminum); 1.25 mm / 0.050 in (brass) | 0.25–0.75° (per side, depending on material) | 35 kg / 77 lb (zinc); 20 kg / 55 lb (magnesium) |
| Centrifugal casting | 5–8 mm / 0.20–0.32 in (small diameters); 10–20 mm / 0.40–0.80 in (large diameters) | 0–1° (in mandrel extraction direction) | Up to 5000 kg / 11000 lb (large diameter tubes) |

In die casting, zinc allows the thinnest walls (0.6 mm / 0.025 in) thanks to its high fluidity at 425 °C / 800 °F and the hot chamber process that accelerates filling. Aluminum alloys with high silicon content, such as AA 390 with 17% Si, improve wear resistance but increase melt viscosity, requiring wall thicknesses greater than 0.9 mm / 0.035 in.

## Advantages and limitations

## Selection guide

The final selection of the casting process responds to a combination of factors: production volume, required material, part geometry, required tolerances, mechanical properties, and available budget. The decision criteria for typical engineering scenarios are presented below.

| Selection criterion | Recommended process | Technical justification |
|---|---|---|
| Mass production (>50000 parts/year), aluminum or zinc alloy, high precision and thin walls | Die casting | High productivity with fast hot chamber (zinc) or cold chamber (aluminum) cycles; accuracy of 0.2% of dimension; wall thicknesses from 0.6 mm / 0.025 in |
| Single part or short runs (<50 pieces), ferrous alloy, large size (>100 kg / 220 lb) | Sand casting | Low mold cost; no practical size limit for green sand; compatible with steels and cast irons |
| High geometric complexity with internal cavities, superalloys or stainless steels, medium runs (100–5000 pieces/year) | Investment casting | Capability for geometries impossible by other methods; zero draft angles; tolerances ±0.1 mm / ±0.004 in; suitable for superalloys |
| Medium runs (1000–20000 pieces/year), aluminum or magnesium alloy, high mechanical requirements | Permanent mold casting | Controlled solidification that improves mechanical properties; lower initial investment than die casting; finish Ra 2.5–6.3 µm / 100–250 µin |
| Tubular or cylindrical parts of ferrous alloy, high metallurgical integrity, diameters 50–1500 mm / 2–60 in | Centrifugal casting | Dense, porosity-free structure due to centrifugal force; elimination of cores; capacity up to 5000 kg / 11000 lb |
| Functional prototypes or very short runs (<20 pieces), any alloy, design validation prior to production | Sand casting (rapid molding with 3D printed cores) | Lead time of days; low cost without tooling investment; flexibility for design iterations |
| Aluminum parts with wear resistance and low porosity requirements, medium-large runs | Die casting (AA 390 alloy with 17% Si) or permanent mold with subsequent heat treatment | AA 390 offers high wear resistance for engine components; permanent mold allows T6 heat treatment to optimize hardness |

For intermediate volumes (500–5000 pieces/year) where die tooling cost is prohibitive, permanent mold casting with sand cores for internal cavities offers an optimal compromise between initial investment, productivity, and quality. In applications with leak-tightness or fatigue requirements, centrifugal casting or investment casting minimize the microporosity that affects fatigue strength.
