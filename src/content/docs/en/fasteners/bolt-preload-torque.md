The tightening torque applied to a bolt generates an axial clamping force, called preload, which ensures the integrity of the joint. The relationship between torque and preload is not linear and depends strongly on friction, nominal diameter, and lubrication condition. Proper sizing prevents both loosening due to insufficient load and failure due to overload.

## Calculation principle and general formula

The accepted formula to estimate the tightening torque from the desired preload is:

\[
T = K \cdot F \cdot d \cdot \left(1 - \frac{l}{100}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(T\) = tightening torque (Nm, lb·ft)
- \(K\) = torque constant (dimensionless)
- \(F\) = axial force or preload on the bolt (N, lb)
- \(d\) = nominal bolt diameter (m, ft)
- \(l\) = reduction factor due to lubrication (%)

The same expression rearranged allows obtaining the force generated for a given torque: \(F = T / (K d (1 - l/100))\). The equation is an approximation that does not consider the thread pitch; it is recommended to validate with manufacturer data. Conventional torque wrenches have a typical accuracy no better than ±25 %.

## Lubrication factors and torque constants

The constant \(K\) absorbs the friction effects under the head and on the thread flanks. It varies according to surface finish and lubrication. The indicative values for low‑alloy steel bolts from 1/4" to 1" (M6–M24) are shown in the following table.

| Surface condition / lubrication | Typical constant K |
| --- | --- |
| Normal dry (uncoated) | 0,20 |
| Black finish uncoated | 0,30 |
| Electrolytic zinc plated | 0,20 |
| Lightly lubricated (light oil) | 0,18 |
| Cadmium plated | 0,16 |

Lubrication reduces friction and therefore the torque required to achieve the same preload. For example, lubricating a bolt with SAE 30 oil reduces the required torque by approximately 40 %. If the dry torque is maintained on a lubricated joint, the actual preload can exceed the bolt strength and cause catastrophic failure.

Design practices establish that the standard dry torque produces a tensile stress in the bolt equal to 70 % of the minimum tensile strength or 75 % of the proof load.

## Dimensions, pitches, and allowable loads according to standards

The following table summarizes the geometric and mechanical characteristics and the main standard equivalences for metric coarse thread bolts (ISO normal pitch). The proof loads correspond to property classes 8.8 and 10.9 according to ISO 898-1. When design requires, proof loads for higher classes (such as 12.9) must be consulted directly from the standards.

## Recommended tightening torques and tap drills

The torques in the following table are calculated to achieve a preload equivalent to 75 % of the proof load with a constant \(K = 0,20\) for dry conditions and \(K = 0,16\) for lightly lubricated. The values are indicative; in critical applications, verification with the bolt manufacturer and control of the tightening method is necessary.

(*) Light lubrication, K ≈ 0,16. For lubrication with SAE 30 oil, an additional reduction of 40 % relative to the dry value may be applied.

## Preload control methods

There are multiple techniques to ensure that the bolt tension approaches the design specification, each with advantages and limitations:

- **Torque-controlled tightening:** It is the simplest and most widespread method. Adjust until a limit torque is reached using a torque wrench. Preload scatter can be high due to friction variations (up to ±25 %).
- **Angle-controlled tightening (or turn-of-nut method):** The joint is rotated a specified angle after seating, taking the material beyond the yield point. Provides repeatable preload, but requires prior tests to define the angle and may degrade the thread upon reuse.
- **Torque-angle tightening (torque-angle tension control):** Combines simultaneous monitoring of torque and rotation angle. Tighten to a threshold torque and then apply an additional angle. Recording the torque vs. angle curve allows process validation and anomaly detection.
- **Yield-controlled tightening:** Detection of the slope of the torque-angle curve identifies the onset of yielding, maximizing preload. Requires specialized tooling.
- **Bolt stretch method:** A hydraulic cylinder stretches the bolt shank; the nut is turned under no load and upon releasing the pressure the preload is set. Common in large-diameter joints.
- **Thermal tightening:** The bolt is heated to expand it, the nut is positioned, and upon cooling the preload is generated. Slow method used in turbines and large equipment.
- **Methods with tension indication:** Include direct measurement of elongation with a comparator, bonded strain gauges, or load-indicating elements built into the fasteners (e.g., bumps that flatten when the target preload is reached).

The selection of the method depends on the criticality of the joint, the bolt size, and production. Torque-angle control systems dominate in the automotive and aerospace industries due to their traceability.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the general formula for calculating tightening torque in bolts?
    The most commonly used expression is \(T = K F d (1 - l/100)\), where the torque \(T\) is obtained by multiplying the torque constant \(K\) (typically 0.2 for normal dry steel), the preload \(F\), and the nominal diameter \(d\), affected by the lubrication reduction \(l\). It does not consider thread pitch and assumes a wrench accuracy of ±25 %.

### What constant K value is recommended for a dry steel bolt?
    For a medium-strength steel bolt, dry and uncoated, \(K = 0.2\). If the finish is black uncoated it can rise to 0.3, while a lightly lubricated bolt drops to 0.18.

### How much does lubrication reduce the required torque?
    When lubricating with SAE 30 oil, the torque required to achieve the same preload is reduced by approximately 40 % compared to the dry value. Therefore, if the dry torque is applied to a lubricated joint, the actual preload may exceed the bolt strength and cause breakage.

### What is the typical target preload relative to bolt strength?
    The standard dry torque is calculated to produce a tensile stress equal to 75 % of the proof load or 70 % of the minimum tensile strength of the bolt, according to general engineering practice.

### What torque is required to tighten a metric M30 class 8.8 bolt dry?
    For an M30 class 8.8 with a proof load of 337 kN (approximately 325 kN in table) under dry conditions (K=0.2) a torque of 2022 Nm / 1492 ft·lb is needed. With lubrication, the torque is reduced to about 1213 Nm / 895 ft·lb.

### What are the most commonly used preload control methods in industry?
    Torque control with a torque wrench is the simplest and most widespread. It is followed by the torque-angle method (torque to threshold + additional turn), pure angle-controlled tightening, and, in critical applications, hydraulic stretch systems and direct tension indicators.
